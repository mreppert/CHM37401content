NumPy arrays are a type of Python variable that serve essentially as matrices to store data (like your experimental results) or for linear algebra operations (like solving systems of linear equations). In the code cell below, you can see the definition of a very simple array that contains the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. \n",
